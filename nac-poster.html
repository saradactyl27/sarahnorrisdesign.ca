        <p class="milli">This project was one of my favourites to work on. We were tasked with creating a mock poster layout for a past NAC dance performance. This project excited me because it was the first time we were allowed to use typography in an expressive way after learning all our fundamentals. </p>
        <p class="milli">My vision was to use the typography to mirror the movement of the dancers from the show. After a lot of sketches and planning I was able to create a layout which mirrored the dancer and felt very expressive.</p>
        <p class="milli">To bring this piece to the next level I decided to create a moving poster with it. By adding motion to the words around the dancer as well as the dancer himself, I was able to increase the dynamic and expressive feel to the poster.</p>
