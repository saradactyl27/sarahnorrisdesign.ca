title: About Me
Meta: I believe graphic designers have the ability to touch peoples hearts, minds, and lives through the work we do. We are on the precipice of a whole new world of design with the constant development of technology and whole new ways of touching people.

      <p>I always wanted a life that created options. Choices of where to live and what to do with my day. I didn’t know what I wanted to do, but I knew it couldn’t be the same boring routine everyday.</p>
      <p>3 years ago I didn’t know what a Graphic Designer did. I didn’t know the job even existed. On my journey to figure out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life I stumbled upon Graphic Design. In no time it grabbed me by the hand and it hasn’t let go.</p>
      <p>I believe graphic designers have the ability to touch peoples hearts, minds, and lives through the work we do. We are on the precipice of a whole new world of design with the constant development of technology and whole new ways of touching people. Innovation is a requirement for this new world and I want to be a part of the journey that takes us there.</p>
