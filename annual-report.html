        <p class="milli">This layout design was very interesting. It presented with a few challenges I was able to really sink into. The task was to create an annual report layout with provided copy. We had a page limit and we had to include infographics for some of their final numbers from 2016.</p>
        <p class="milli">The final layout design is one I am proud of as it was one of my first large scale designs. It is a clean look with a consistent layout throughout the report.</p>
